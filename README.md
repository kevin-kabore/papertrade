## Paper Trade

Paper Trade is a MERN stack paper trading application

### Technologies Used

Axios: let us use HTTP methods to communicate with our database.

Express: provide a framework to set up our Node.js server.

Body Parser: parse the incoming requests bodies for the info we are sending (gives us access to req.body which we will be using soon).

Foreman: allows us to boot up our API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously.

Nodemon: watches our server.js file for changes, then restarts it.

Marked: to convert markdown syntax to html. I used this in place of Remarkable (which the FB tutorial uses)

Mongoose: abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.
